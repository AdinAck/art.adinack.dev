I'm Adin, an electrical and software engineer from San Diego, CA.

My main passion is creating embedded systems for safety-critical applications (personal electric vehicles). You can see all of my interests [here](/interests).

## Statement of Purpose

Modern systems demand modern design philosophies.
The fight against obfuscation and fragility is not for the faint of heart.
An engineer who is not thoughtful, patient, and determined is not qualified to develop systems that people depend on.

***When lives are on the line, the cost of laziness far outweighs the cost of effort.***
